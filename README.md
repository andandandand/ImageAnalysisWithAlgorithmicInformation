A layered version of the Block Decomposition Method [1, 2] ("Layered BDM"), serves as a descriptor of both weighted networks and grayscale or color images.  This descriptor provides an estimate of Kolmogorov Complexity that's sensitive to morphological perturbation.  To estimate the complexity of a grayscale texture, we quantize it and aggregate the estimated Kolmogorov complexity values of binary 4 x 4 squares, estimated through the Coding Theorem Method [3, 4].

### Pseudocode description of the Layered BDM algorithm
```
// CTMs is a hashtable with binary 2D blocks as keys
// their respective values being estimations of Kolmogorov complexity 
// obtained through the Coding Theorem Method
function LayeredBDM (grayImage, CTMs, blockSize, blockOffset, q)

	// the image is quantized in q digital levels
	imag <- quantize(grayImage, q)
	
	blocksList = {}
	for i in 1:q
	    // the quantized image is binarized through the q digital layers
   		binImag <- binarize(i, imag)
   		// and decomposed into n x n blocks, which are added to the blockList
   		blocksList.append(blockDecompose(binImag, blockSize, blockOffset))

	// we count the appearance of all binary blocks through all layers 
	// and store the count of each into a hash table with the blocks as keys
	// and the blockCount as values
	blockHT(blocks:blockCount) <- countBlocks(blockList)

	// The blocks' CTM values are retrieved from the CTMs hashtable, these and 
	// the Log2 of the cardinality of each are added to compute the BDM value
	lBDM <- CTMs(keys(blockHT)) + Log2(values(blockHT))
	return(lBDM)

```
